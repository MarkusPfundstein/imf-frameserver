=head1 NAME

EVP_MAC_BLAKE2 - The BLAKE2 EVP_MAC implementation

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Support for computing BLAKE2 MACs through the B<EVP_MAC> API.

=head2 Numeric identity

B<EVP_MAC_BLAKE2B> and B<EVP_MAC_BLAKE2S> are the numeric identities for this
implementation, and can be used in functions like EVP_MAC_CTX_new_id() and
EVP_get_macbynid().

=head2 Supported controls

The supported controls are:

=over 4

=item B<EVP_MAC_CTRL_SET_KEY>

This is a string value of at most 64 bytes for EVP_MAC_BLAKE2B
or 32 for EVP_MAC_BLAKE2S and at least 1 byte in both cases.
This must be set before calling EVP_MAC_init().

EVP_MAC_ctrl_str() takes two type strings for this control:

=over 4

=item "key"

The value string is used as is.

=item "hexkey"

The value string is expected to be a hexadecimal number, which will be
decoded before passing on as control value.

=back

=item B<EVP_MAC_CTRL_SET_CUSTOM>

This is an optional string value of at most 16 bytes for EVP_MAC_BLAKE2B
or 8 for EVP_MAC_BLAKE2S, set to all-NULL by default.
If used this must be set before calling EVP_MAC_init().

EVP_MAC_ctrl_str() takes two type strings for this control:

=over 4

=item "custom"

The value string is used as is.

=item "hexcustom"

The value string is expected to be a hexadecimal number, which will be
decoded before passing on as control value.

=back

=item B<EVP_MAC_CTRL_SET_SALT>

This is an optional string value of at most 16 bytes for EVP_MAC_BLAKE2B
or 8 for EVP_MAC_BLAKE2S, set to all-NULL by default.
If used this must be set before calling EVP_MAC_init().

EVP_MAC_ctrl_str() takes two type strings for this control:

=over 4

=item "salt"

The value string is used as is.

=item "hexsalt"

The value string is expected to be a hexadecimal number, which will be
decoded before passing on as control value.

=back

=item B<EVP_MAC_CTRL_SET_SIZE>

EVP_MAC_ctrl_str() type string: "outlen"

This is an optional value string containing a decimal number between 1 and
32 for EVP_MAC_BLAKE2S or 64 for EVP_MAC_BLAKE2B.
If it is not set it uses the default digest size of 32 and 64 respectively.
If used this must be set before calling EVP_MAC_init().
